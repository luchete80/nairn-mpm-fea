<h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> is a graphical interface and front end to running and
visualizing finite element calculations (FEA) and material point method calculations
(MPM) in the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> computational mechanics package. The calculations are done by the package's code engines called <code>NairnFEA</code> (for FEA) and <code>NairnMPM</code> (for MPM). In brief, this Java application does the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interprets <a href="#opencmds">input command files</a> that are usually scripts to define a calculation. The result of the interpretation will be <code>XML</code> command to input to the code engines.</li>
<li>Launches tasks using the code engines to <a href="#running">run calculations</a> based on the interpreted <code>XML</code> commands.</li>
<li>When done, the output of the calculations are opened to  to <a href="#viz">visualize</a> the results.</li>
<li>If desired, the above steps can be automated by <a href="#script">application-level scripting</a>. For example, an application can automate running multiple calculations and compiling of results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another use of this application is just to interpret a script and save the resulting <code>XML</code> commands to a file. This file can be copied to a server to run long calculations remotely. Once done, the remove calculations can be opened in this application for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>. The task of running on a remote server (<i>i.e.</i>, copy <code>XML</code> commands to a server, launching a calculation, and then opening (or copying and opening) the remote results in this application)can be  automated using <a href="#runserver">remote calculation</a> options.</p> 

<p>This documentation is very brief. More complete documentation of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> package is given on the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> (which can also be accessed using the "internet" icon in this help window's tool bar.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="opencmds"></a>Commands Files</h1>

<h2>Opening or Creating a Commands File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an existing commands file, choose the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing dialog box or choose
file from the &quot;Open Recent&quot; submenu.
Command files usually have extension <code>fmcmd</code> but can also have <code>fcmd</code>,
<code>mcmd</code>, or just <code>cmd</code>. To restrict the files you can open to just
command files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Command Files&quot; from the file format menu.
If the file you want to open does not show up, you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot;
from the menu instead.
</p>

<p>To create a new commands file, select &quot;New FEA Commands&quot; or &quot;New MPM Commands&quot; menu command (or click the &quot;F&quot; or &quot;M&quot; icon, respectively. These options
will open a new file with a template of commands for that type of calculation. The FEA template is commands for a simple cantilever beam; the MPM template creates a grid with a reactangular block of material points.
Before you run calculations using new commands, they must be saved to disk. Use the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon) to save to any location.
</p>

<p>To see various sample command files, choose any item in the "Examples" submenu. The selected samples will open as a new document and must be saved to disk before <a href="#start">running calculations</a>. See comments in the files for information on its calculations and options for alterning the calculations.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="entercmds"></a>Entering Commands<hr></h2>

<p>Once commands are open, you can edit the commands using basic text editing methods. You 
can choose font to use for "Editing" in the "Fonts" tab of the preferences window.</p>

<p>There are two types of command files. The recommended approach is to use the built-in scripting language. Using scripts provides maximum flexibility in setting up calculations because they can contain things like variables, conditionals, repeat loop, <i>etc</i>. When you interpret a script, the commands create XML commands that are sent to the code engines. See the help topic on <a href="commands.html">scripting commands</a> for more details (or click the "note pad" icon in this window's tool bar to access that help).</p>

<p>An alternate approach is to directly enter the XML commands supported by the <code>NairnFEA</code> and <code>NairnMPM</code> code engines This approach is much less flexible than scripted commands and this help has no information of the format for XML commands. If you need to know about XML commands, you can refer to the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> (the wiki's XML information is sometimes useful when debugging scripted files too).</p>

<p>You can save the commands at any time using the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu 
commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon).
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="running"></a>Running Calculations</h1>

<p>The section explains how to launch calculations. Once the calculations are done,
the results will automatically open for visualization.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up the System<hr></h2>

<p>Before you can run any calculations in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, you have to download
and compile the <code>NairnFEA</code> and <code>NairnMPM</code> code engines.
These code engines can be installed on any platform. The details are not given is this
help. Instead refer to the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> wiki page (see <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> or using "internet" icon in tool bar). The wiki has complete instructions for getting the package and compiling the code engines.
</p>

<h3>Setting Code and DTD File Locations</h3>

<p>Once the code engines are compiled, you have to configure <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> to
know the location of the compiled binaries and (optionally) their <code>DTD</code> files.
The process is:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the &quot;Preferences...&quot; menu command (or click the
&quot;Prefs&quot; icon).</li>

<li>Select the &quot;Code&quot; tab</li>

<li>Click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the  &quot;MPM Code Path&quot; and select
the <code>NairnMPM</code> (or <code>NairnMPM.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnMPM</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;MPM DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnMPM.dtd</code> file. To validate MPM calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option (recommended); uncheck it to skip validation.</li>

<li>Repeat for the &quot;FEA Code Path&quot; and select the <code>NairnFEA</code>
(or <code>NairnFEA.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnFEA</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;FEA DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnFEA.dtd</code> file. To validate FEA calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option (recommended); uncheck it to skip validation.</li>

</ol>

<p>Another option is to click the "Use Bundle" button, which will change all file names
to "$(bundle)". When this specific text is entered, the corresponding file will be
expected to be in a folder called "bundle" that is in the same folder as the
<b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> jar file. If that folder also has xerces library and dll libraries
needed in Windows, the folder contain the jar file and the bundle folder can be copied
to another computer and run as a stand-alone system.</p>

<h3><a name="native"></a>Setting the Shell Command Path</h3>

<p>The shell command option depends on the system and option you are using to run the <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> app:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Windows Native</dt>
<dd>This option means the <code>.exe</code> files that were created using Visual Studio and can be run using a Windows command line. When using this option, the "Shell Command" is not used and is permanently set to "$(windows)". Any <code>dll</code> files needed by the code engines should in the ame folders as the excutables.</dd>

<dt>Mac, Unix, or Linux</dt>
<dd>The "Shell Command" is only used when running background jobs. To allow that option, click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the &quot;Shell Command&quot;
and select the <code>bash</code> file (which is usually at <code>/bin/bash</code>).</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Setting Work Space Folder</h3>

<p>You can optionally define a work space folder using the &quot;Change...&quot; button
in the &quot;Work Space Directory&quot; section. Select any folder and that folder
will be the default folder when opening and saving files. Any change made to the
work space will only affect new windows.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="start"></a>Starting FEA or MPM Analysis<hr></h2>

<p>To run an FEA or MPM analysis using the commands in the front window:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose &quot;Run FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; from the Analyze menu (or click the &quot;Run&quot;
arrow icon). If the commands have not yet
been saved to a file, you will have to save them first.
</li>

<li>Next, a file-choosing dialog will open for you enter where to save the output results.
Choose a file with extension <code>fea</code> for FEA calculations or with extension
<code>mpm</code> for MPM calculations. Some important points are:

<ul>
<li>If you select an existing output file, the new results will overwrite that
file without asking.</li>

<li>If you do not use the proper extension, it will be added to the file for you.</li>

<li>As a convenience, when you re-run a calculation, the dialog to select the output
file will initially select the previous output file and you can click OK to select
and overwrite it.</li>

<li>If you select a different folder than the one with the input commands file,
a copy of the commands file will be written to that folder too. If a commands file of
the selected name is already in that folder, the copy will overwrite that file without asking.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The calculation will run and the output will stream to the bottom of the commands window.
When the calculation is done, the output results will automatically
open for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>. You 
can choose the font to use for "Output" text in the "Fonts" tab of the preferences window.</li>

<li>You can stop a calculation in progress with the &quot;Stop&quot; menu command.
If any results were finished, you can click the &quot;Image&quot; icon
to open the partial results for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>.
<b>Note</b>: there may be a slight delay after selecting &quot;Stop&quot; before the task terminates
and the file is saved and ready for visualization.
</ol>

<h3>Background Jobs</h3>

<p>For long calculations, it is convenient to submit them as background jobs.
To submit a background job, choose the &quot;Background FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; menu command.
The subsequent steps are identical to running a calculation except that once submitted, nothing streams to the commands window. You can then proceed with other calculations or even quit <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>. The background job will run until it is complete. Once it is complete, you can <a href="#opening">open the results file for visualization</a>.
</p>

<p>The background option is currently not available when using the <a href="#native">Windows Native</a> mode.</p>

<h3>Checking the Mesh</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is convenient to start a calculation, set up the mesh, but
then abort before continuing. This option is useful for checking
the setup of the problem to verify the mesh, particles,
and/or boundary conditions are correct. You can <a href="#opening">open the problem setup for
visualization</a> and plot the initial mesh. To use this option, select
the &quot;Test FEA/MPM Mesh...&quot; command (or click the &quot;Check&quot; arrow icon).
The subsequent steps are identical to
running a calculation except that once the problem is setup, the calculation will abort,
the output file will be opened for visualization, and the initial mesh will
appear in a plot window.</p>

<h3>Interpreting Commands</h3>

<p>Choosing the &quot;Interpret Commands...&quot; menu command will display the XML input file
in the bottom half of the commands window, but will not launch the code engines.
This command is most useful when using scripting commands and you want to verify they are creating the expected XML input file. You can refer to the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> for information on the XML command formats.</p>

<p>Another use of this option is to create XML commands to be submitted for analysis on another computer. You can use the &quot;Export Output...&quot; command to save the contents of the output pane (which will have the XML commands) to a plain text file. You should use extension <code>.fmcmd</code> when saving XML commands.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="script"></a>Using Script Control<hr></h2>

<p>A powerful feature of <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> is that you can run under script control that lets you perform a series of calculations or tasks and summarize the results in a report. The details for using script control are described in a <a href="scripting.html">separate help topic</a>.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="remote"></a>Running Remote Calculations</h1>

<p>A powerful feature of this application is that it can run calculations remotely. With this feature you can run calculations even if you current computer does not have any of the required binaries for calculations. This section explains the process.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="setserver"></a>Setup Remove Servers<hr></h2>

<p>To run remote calculations, you need access to an account on a server that has NairnMPM and NairnFEA installed. If that is available, you can set up any number of servers as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the &quot;Preferences...&quot; menu command (or click the
&quot;Prefs&quot; icon).</li>

<li>Select the &quot;Remote&quot; tab</li>

<li>Use the "Server" pop-up menu to select a server to edit or to add a new server. First, you should test connecting to the server using:
<pre>ssh (username)@(servername)
</pre>
and enter your <code>(password)</code> to connect. If needed, agree to have the server added to your list of known hosts. Once you can connect, the server should work. Enter the connection details as follows:

<ul>

<li>Enter the <code>(servername)</code> to connect in the "Server Name" field.</li>

<li>Enter the <code>(username)</code> and <code>(password</code> to connect in the two fields. The password will not display, but it will be saved unencrypted in an application preferences file. You can omit the password, but will then have to enter a password before each remote calculation.</li>

<li>In the next four fields, enter full paths to MPM and FEA binaries and DTD files on the server. If the files are in your home directory, you can use home directory short cut in the code paths (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>~/bin/NairnMPM</code>), but the DTD files must always use the complete full path to the files.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>To delete a server, first select it from the "Server" menu and then choose the "Delete Server" command from that menu.</li>

<li>Finally, use the radio buttons to select "local" (to run with local copies of binaries listed in the "Code" preferences) or "remote" (to run calculations remotely on the specified server and using the binaries on the server).</li>


</ol>


<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="runserver"></a>Remote Calculations<hr></h2>

<p>To run remote calculations, select the server to use from the "Server" popup menu and select the "Remote" option. Both of these settings are done in the "Remote" pane of of the preferences window (note: if you do not select a server, the calculations will use the first server in the popup menu list of servers). Once <a href="#setserver">servers are configured</a>, remote calculations are started the same way you <a href="#start">start local calculations</a>. The difference is that instead of choosing an output file, a dialog box appears where you choose remote calculation options. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code><a name="remoutput"></a>Remote Output</code><br>
Enter a relative file path from your home directory on the server to the desired output file for the calculations. The relative path must contain at least one parent folder (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>RemoteOut/TwoDisks.mpm</code> where <code>TwoDisks.mpm</code> is the output file and <code>RemoteOut</code> is one parent folder). The path can contain more than one parent folder and the folders need not exist (they will be created if needed). If the file does not have the correct extension (<code>.mpm</code> or <code>.fea</code>), it will be added for you.
</li>
<li><code><a name="remoptions"></a>Remote Output Options</code><br>
The radio buttons under the remote output field provide three options for the remote files:
<ol>
<li><code>Overwrite</code>: the default option is to overwrite files with the same names in the provided server parent folder.
If you do not want to overwrite prior calculations, you should provide at least one non-existing folder in the "Remote Output" path.</li>
<li>Create Unique (<code>Unique</code>): with this option, the output will create a unique subfolder in the server parent folder. The new folder will be named "<code>out#</code>" where "<code>#</code>" is a number selected as needed to provide a unique name and output will be sent to that new folder. Running lots of remote calculations in this mode could eventually fill up server disk space.</li>
<li>Clear Parent (<code>Clear</code>): with this option, the entire contents of the parent folder to the "Remote Output" file will be deleted before the calculations begin. This option is useful when running and downloading different types of calculations with output to the same folder on the server
(see <a href="#dlnotes">below</a>), but be careful not to delete files you need
(<i>e.g.</i>, if the parent folder corresponds to an existing folder in your home directory with files you want to keep).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><code><a name="locoptions"></a>Local Folder</code><br>
When remote calculations are done, they can be automatically downloaded to a local folder on your computer to allow this application to open and visualize results. This field has the full path of any folder on your local disk or any mounted disk. Click the "Change..." button to select a different folder. The three options for this local folder, which are selected with the menu below the field, are:
<ol>
<li>Download to this Folder (<code>Download</code>): When calculations are done, the entire parent folder to the "Remote Output" file is zipped to an archive file, downloaded to the local folder, and unzipped to a folder with the same name as the parent folder (see notes <a href="#dlnotes">below</a> on downloading). If a folder of that name already exists in the local folder, the downloaded files will replace those files with the same name, but leave files with different names in place.</li>
<li>Do not Download (<code>NoDownload</code>): This option will not download the files and therefore the results will not be opened for visualization. The calculations will remain on the server for you to access manually at a later time. Once the remote calculations are launched, the connection is terminated and you can start other calculations (local or remote) while they are running.</li>
<li>Home Directory on Server (<code>Home</code>): This option specifies that the provided local folder is your home directory on the server running the remote calculations (in other words, you have mounted the server and can select your home folder with the "Change..." button). Because the server is mounted, there is no need to download the calculation results. Instead, this application will just open the file using the "Remote Output" relative path from the provided home directory. This mode is the fastest method if you are able to mount your home directory on the server with high-speed access.
</ol>
</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Troubleshooting</b>: if remote calculations fail to launch, the most likely problem is connection to the server. As explained in help for <a href="#setserver">setting up servers</a>, make should you can connect to the server by <code>ssh</code> using provided server settings and that nothing, such as firewalls or host verification, interferes with that connection.</p>

<p><a name="dlnotes"></a><b>Notes on Downloading</b>: when using the <code>Download</code> option, the download will have the entire contents of the parent folder to the "Remote Output" file, which will include all other files that were in that folder before the remote calculations were run. For example, if you run two different calculations that create different file names in the same remote output folder, the second one will download the results of both calculations. To avoid this download of unnecessary files (which may dramatically slow downloads), you can use either the <code>Unique</code> or <code>Clear</code> options as described <a href="#remoptions">above</a>. The <code>Unique</code> option is best when running a series of calculations and you want to save all results. The <code>Clear</code> is best when running calculations but do not need to archive the output files for later analysis (but be careful that use of this option will not delete prior files you want to keep).</p>

<h1><a name="viz"></a>Visualizing Results</h1>

<p>This section explains how to visualization FEA or MPM results. The results can be from
calculations you just ran in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> or from prior results run another day
or even on another computer using different software.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="newcalcs"></a>Visualization Completed Calculations<hr></h2>

<p>If you <a href="#start">run calculations</a> within <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, the results
will automatically open ready for visualization. You 
can choose the font to use for "Results" text in the "Fonts" tab of the preferences window. While viewing the results, you can click
the &quot;Editer&quot; icon to switch back to the commands window. From the commands window,
you can switch back to the result window by clicking the &quot;Image&quot; icon. Even if
the result window has been closed, the &quot;Image&quot; icon will reopen the
most-recently completed calculations for those commands during the current
use of <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="opening"></a>Opening a File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an output results file from previous calculations, choose
the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing
dialog box or choose a file from the &quot;Open Recent&quot; submenu.
Output results files usually have extension <code>fea</code> or <code>mpm</code>.
To restrict the files you can open to just output files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Output Files&quot;
from the file format menu. If the file you want to open does not show up,
you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot; from the menu instead.
You should select only the main text output files from <code>NairnFEA</code> or
<code>NairnMPM</code> and not any associated text or binary file.</p>

<p>Once a file is selected, it will open and the results will be loaded into a window:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each section of results will be listed on the top-left. Click on any section to see it.</li>

<li>The text from the selected section will appear on the top-right.</li>

<li>The bottom of the window will be a control panel for selecting all plotting options.</li>

</ul>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="plotting"></a>Plotting Results<hr></h2>

<p>To visualize results:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the desired type of plot:

<br><img src="ParticlePlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#movies">Movie plots of MPM results</a> based on particle results.
<br><img src="TimePlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#timeplot">Plots <i>vs.</i> time</a> for MPM results
<br><img src="MeshPlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#meshplots">Mesh plots of MPM or FEA results</a>. MPM results are particle results
extrapolated to the mesh and plotted as movies <i>vs.</i> time. FEA plots are full mesh plots.
<br><img src="Mesh2DPlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#mesh2Dplots">Plots along mesh contours</a> of MPM or FEA results.
</li>

<li>Once the plot type is selected, follow the blue line to select all plotting options for
that type of plot. See information on that plot type for details.
</li>

<li>When all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
to plot the results. The plot will appear in a new window.
</li>

<li>To <a href="#pcolors">customize plot colors</a>, use the "Colors" tab of the Preferences window.</li>

<li>To get a new plot, select new options and click the &quot;Plot&quot; button again
(which may have changed to &quot;Replot&quot; or &quot;Add Plot&quot;, depending on plot type
and if the previous plot window is still open) or use the plotting menu command or icon.
</li>

<li>The &quot;Scale Results...&quot; menu command can scale length and time units. It only
affects the mesh, particle locations, velocities, and concentration gradients. Stresses remain in

<p>First select the plotting options</p>

<ul>
<li>The first pop-up menu selects the calculation result to plot.
The menu will display all options available in the opened file.
For some results, you can select a component of that quantity
(<i>e.g.</i> the <i>xx</i> component of the stress tensor). Use "Expression.." to <a href="#pexpr">plot any function of calculation results</a>. The "Import..." option does not apply to particle plot movies.</li>

<li>The slider selects the initial time to plot for MPM results.
</li>

<li>The check boxes select various options for the plot; check the desired options.
The slider along with the check boxes sets the size of the particles in the plot relative
to the cell size in the background mesh. The default is 100%. A larger size can fill space better while
a smaller size can help to visualize individual material points. All settings made for the next plot are saved in preferences and will be used in subsequent plots.</li>

<li><a name="limits"></a>The limits box has three options.
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Limits: adjust limits of each frame to maximum and minimum of the frame data.</li>

<li>Global Dynamic Limits: adjust limits to global minimum and maximum of all previously
plotted data in that window. After going through all frames once, the minimum and maximum will
be the limits of all data sets.</li>

<li>Fixed Limits: Enter desired minimum and maximum in the provided fields.</li>

<li> Note: you can change limits options for the current plot. The new limits will take effect when you plot a new frame or if you click the &quot;Replot&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot; icon)
and the plot will appear in a new window. A key to the plot colors will appear
at the bottom of the plot area.
You can resize the window to scale the plot size to the new window size.
</p>

<p>You can use slider at the bottom of the window to plot results at
different times or use the &quot;Play,&quot;
&quot;Rewind,&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; buttons to run a movie of MPM results.</p>

<p>You can use the quantity and component menus to plot a new
simulation result or new component of the current simulation result. To change other plot features, go back
to the &quot;Analysis Results&quot; window, select new options, and plot again.</p>

<p>The particle size slider (labeled "PS") can be used to adjust the particle
size in the plot as a percent of the cell size.</p>

<p>The maximum elongation slider (labeled "Max F") can be used to adjust maximum elongation plotted
for transformed particles (and "0" means no maximum). This setting is most useful when plotting fluids
that transform to needles after much cumulative strain. Limiting the maximum (<i>e.g.</i>, to "5") can give
more useful plots.</p>

<p>To zoom in or out on the current plot, choose a scale setting from the &quot;Zoom&quot;
menu; the window will zoom around its current center location. Choose &quot;100%&quot; to see the entire plot. The zoom level is relative to the current window size and will remain so as the window is resized.
</p>
<p>
To zoom in or out around a specific point, right click on the location (or click with Mac Command key down). To zoom out at a point, right click on the location with the Alt key down (or click with Mac Option and Command keys down). On a Mac, the cursor will change to "+" or "-" icon when Command or Command and Option keys are down and the mouse moves.
</p>

<p>You can move the mouse over the plot area. As it moves, the control bar will
display the coordinates of the mouse location (x and y),
the nearest element (el), the nearest node (nd), the nearest material point (mp), and
the plotting value of the nearest material point (z)
</p>

<p><a name="exportpng"></a>The &quot;Export Graphics...&quot; command in the &quot;File&quot; menu
will export the current frame to a <code>png</code> file using a name you provide.
The &quot;Export Movie Frames...&quot; command will export a series of
frames (starting from current) to the end of the frames (or until the pause control is clicked).
The names of the exported frames will use the base name you enter and append a number
(<i>e.g.</i>, 0022) for the frame index number just prior to the <code>.png</code>
extension. These saved files will overwrite any files in the target folder with the same name.
This naming can be read by other software (such as reading an &quot;Image Sequence&quot; into ImageJ)
that can convert the frames to a movie.</p>

<h2><a name="export"></a>Exporting Particle Plot Data<hr></h2>

<p>The "Export Particle VTKs" command runs the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">ExtractMPM</a> tool to export particle data in the simulation results to <code>VTK</code> files (or optionally to other file formats). These files can then be opened in third-party visualization tools to provide more visualization options (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="https://www.paraview.org">Paraview</a> or <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit">VisIt</a>). The export process is as follows:

<ol>
<li>Choose the "Export Particle VTKs" menu command and a dialog box appears</li>
<li>Enter a root name into the editing field. The exported files will be in the same folder as the simulation's archive files and their names will append underscore, step number, and extension "vtk" ro your entered root name (<i>e.g.</i>, "RootName_34.vtk"). If a file of that name already exists, it will be overwritten. Most third-party visualization tools will recognize such a set of files as a group of vtk files to opened together and ordered by step number.</li>
<li>Use the "Insert..." menu to select any number of particle quantities to include in the exported files. The menu will list all data that is both available in the current simulation and is supported by the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">ExtractMPM</a> tool.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can type quantities into the editing field on the right. Type one quantity per line. The quantities are case sensitive and must match a <code>-q</code> option documented for the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">ExtractMPM</a> tool.</li>
<li>Alternatively, click the "Default Set" to replace all currently entered export options with the most-commonly exported quantities that are available in the current data. After getting these default quantities, you can delete any not needed or add more by typing or by using the "Insert..." menu.</li>
<li>When done entering all quantities, click "Save" to export all results to a series of <code>VTK</code> files.
</ol>

<p>The export process is handled using the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">ExtractMPM</a> tool and its executable must be in the same folder used for the NairnMPM binary when you <a href="setup">setup the system</a>. The output will be streamed to the text area in the box. If the export is taking too long, you can abort the process using the "Cancel" button. If an error occurs, an alert window will explain the problem and you can try again. After an export finishes, the "Reset" button will be enabled to reset the export commands in case you want to alter the export options and try again.</p>

<h2>ExtractMPM Options</h3>

<p>The above process handles most needs, but you can also make use of other features in the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">ExtractMPM</a> tool. Any line in the editing field on the right that does not begin in a dash (-) is assumed to be a quantity for exporting (it is passed to ExtractMPM using a -q command). Any line starting in a dash is assumed to be valid command and is passed to ExtractMPM when run. You can use any <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/ExtractMPM">valid ExtractMPM command</a>. The most commonly used options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-T</code>: export to tab-delimited text files. This command is best used in conjunction with <code>-h</code> that includes a header with information about what is in each column of the files.</li>
<li><code>-M #</code>: include material number specified by "#" in the export. If no <code>-M</code> commands are used, all materials are exported. If any are used, only the specified materials are exported.</li>
<li><code>-m #</code>: omit material with number specified by "#" from the export. If a material is both included and omitted, the omission take precedence.</code>

<li>The first pop-up menu selects the calculation result to plot. The menu will display
all options available in the opened file.
For some results, you can select a component of that quantity (<i>e.g.</i> the <i>xx</i>
component of the stress tensor). Use "Expression.." to <a href="#pexpr">plot any function of calculation results</a>. The "Import..." will import and plot tab-delimited data from a file; a file chooser to select the file will appear when you add the plot.</li>

<li>For MPM results, the plot will be generated from results at one specific time.
Use the time slider to selected the desired time results to plot.
</li>

<li>The plot will be along a selected path through the mesh as determined by a pop-up menu:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>For FEA and 2D MPM</i>: the first four options can select &quot;<code>x=</code>&quot;
to give <code>x</code> as a
function of <code>y</code>, &quot;<code>y=</code>&quot; to give <code>y</code> as
a function of <code>x</code>, &quot;<code>D=</code>&quot; to give distance from
the origin <code>D</code> as a function of polar angle <code>T</code> (<i>i.e.</i>, counter-clockwise angle from the positive <code>x</code> axis), or &quot;<code>T=</code>&quot; to give <code>T</code> as a function of <code>D</code>. For each option, enter the function as an expression of the allowed variable in the text field. 
The resulting plot will be for mesh values of the selected plot quantity as a function of
distance along the path. For MPM, the mesh values are found by extrapolating particle values to the grid (and will be zero in in mesh regions with no particles).
The expression for the path can be a constant value. A constant <code>x=</code> contour will
be a vertical line. A constant <code>y=</code> contour will be a horizontal line.
A constant <code>D=</code> contour will be a circle with the entered radius.
A constant <code>T=</code> contour will be a line from the origin at that polar angle T.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>For MPM only</i>: The <code>p:x+dt=</code> and  <code>p0:x+dt</code>
options will plot data from particles that fall near a line defined by x + d*t where x is any point and t is a vector in the direction of the line. The "p" option finds particles based on their current position; the "p0" option finds them based on their initial position.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. For 2D MPM, enter 1, 2, or 4 comma-separated numbers. For 1, the plot is a contour for constant x as function of distance for left edge of the grid. For 2, the plot is a function of constant y in the second number as function of distance from the bottom of the grid (the first number is ignored). For 4, the first two points give a point x and the second two give a direction t. The plot is a function of the distance from the defined point x.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For 3D MPM, enter 4 or 6 comma-separated numbers. For 4, the plot is contour parallel to the i<sup>th</sup> axis where i is 1, 2, or 3 for x, y or z and is entered in the 4<sup>th</sup> number. The line is for the other two axes held constant at values entered in the first three number (the i<sup>th</sup> number is ignored). The plot is as a function of distance from the minimum edge of the grid along the i<sup>th</sup> axis. For 6, the first three points give a point x and the second three give a direction t. The plot is a function of the distance from the defined point x. 
</li>

<li>The &quot;+/-&quot; field can enter a range for calculating an average plot quantity.
If it is not zero, the selected quantity will be averaged over that distance on
both sides of the path and normal to the path. But for MPM particle plots (<code>p:x+dt==</code> and <code>p0:x+dt==</code>), a non-zero will instead extend the plot to include any particle whose position is within its radius or this value (whichever is larger) of the selected contour.</li>

<li>For crack results (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Crack Profile&quot;) select the crack number.
Cracks are numbered starting from 1. For crack plots, the plot will be along the crack
path and thus there is no need to select a contour (see previous step) and no need to
select a crack tip (as needed for crack tip parameters in <a href="#timeplot">time plots</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
and the plot will
appear in a new window. You can plot additional quantities on the same plot by selecting
new options (while the previous plot window is still open) and then clicking the
&quot;Add Plot&quot; button (or using the menu command or icon).

<h2><a name="viz3D"></a>Visualizing 3D MPM Results<hr></h2>

<p>You can <a href="#start">run 3D calculations</a> using this tool or run 3D calculations on
a standard command line and even open the results in this Java application, but the visualization options
are very limited. You can only look at text output
and plot results <i>vs.</i> time. Two ways to visualize 3D results are:</p>

<ol>
<li>To plot mesh results, use the <a href="https://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/VTKArchive_Custom_Task">VTKArchive Custom Task</a> to write results to a structured grid in <code>VTK</code> files.</li>
<li>To plot particle data, <a href="#export">export particle data</a> to point-based <code>VTK</code> files.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two styles of <code>VTK</code> files can be opened in thrid-party visualization tools (such as <a href="https://www.paraview.org">Paraview</a> or <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit">VisIt</a>). For more information on visualizing 3D results, see the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page#Visualization">OSUPDOcs wiki</a>.</p>
